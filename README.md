# Dinosaur Game Clone

The [dinosaur game](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-dino/) is an easter egg that appears in the web browser of Google Chrome. You can access the original game at `chrome://dino`.

Here's a js-based clone of the dinosaur game written to learn.

You can examine the chromium [source](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/neterror/resources/offline.js;l=7?q=t-rex%20package:%5Echromium$&ss=chromium) codes I used for the clone and this [repo](https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner).
